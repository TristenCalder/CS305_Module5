# CS305_Module5
This is a README

A project i would like to make progress on would be a YouTube downloader using python.
I started this project using the PyTube library using 4 lines of code i found on the internet.
I ran it and it didnt work, there were dozens of errors
I then found a reddit thread discussing that the library was out of date and didnt interface with Youtube anymore
I then gave up until PyTube gets updated and havent worked on it since. 

###Yeah. Sometimes things become outdated but if you can learn how to update the library, you can possibly use the pytube. -Jake Borneman
